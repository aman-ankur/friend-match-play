# Active Context: Card Connection (Initial Setup)

## 1. Current Focus

The primary focus is establishing the initial Memory Bank documentation based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD) and analyzing the existing codebase structure. This involves creating the core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** This is the first step in creating the Memory Bank. The `memory-bank` directory and the initial versions of `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` have just been created.
- **Codebase Status (Inferred):** Based on the file structure, foundational UI components (`RoomCreation`, `GameRoom`, specific game modes like `GuessWhoIAm`, `HotTakes`, `ThisOrThat`, `ResultComparison`) and supporting elements (`useGameLogic` hook, `game.ts` types, `gameQuestions.ts`) appear to exist. The exact functionality and completeness of these components are yet to be fully assessed against the PRD.
- **Gameplay Timer Fixes (Nov 2023):** Addressed significant bugs related to the round timer in `GameRoom.tsx`.
    - Server now emits `roundComplete` when both players answer.
    - Client handles `roundComplete` to stop the timer.
    - Fixed timer not restarting or counting down correctly between rounds by correcting `useEffect` dependencies and state management logic in `GameRoom.tsx`.
- **UI Improvements (Apr 2024):** Fixed text wrapping issues in game selection cards.
    - Implemented comprehensive solution for proper text wrapping in the game selection grid
    - Added appropriate CSS classes at multiple container levels to ensure proper overflow handling, width constraints, and word breaking
    - Enhanced user experience by ensuring game descriptions display properly within their containers

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Complete Memory Bank Setup:** Create the remaining core files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
2.  **Code Review & Alignment:** Once the Memory Bank is established, review the existing code components (`src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/types`, `src/utils`) in detail to understand their current state and align them with the requirements documented in the Memory Bank.
3.  **Identify Gaps:** Determine missing features or functionalities based on the PRD and the code review.
4.  **Plan Implementation:** Outline the tasks needed to implement missing features and refine existing ones.
5.  **Continue with Feature Development:** Based on `progress.md`, the next focus areas are likely Prediction Mode logic and Solo Mode refinement.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Documentation First:** Prioritizing the creation of the Memory Bank ensures a shared understanding of the project goals and current state before proceeding with further development.
- **Leverage Existing Code:** Acknowledge the presence of existing components and plan to integrate/refactor them as needed, rather than starting entirely from scratch (unless a review deems it necessary).
- **PRD as Source of Truth:** Use the provided PRD as the primary guide for required features and functionality.
