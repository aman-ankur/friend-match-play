# Active Context - Friend Match Play

## Current Focus (as of May 2024)

1. **Round Summary Feature Development**
   - Creating a dedicated summary screen to display after each round
   - Implementing animation for better user experience
   - Planning share/save functionality for future development

2. **Temporary Disconnection Handling**
   - Implementing grace period for player disconnections
   - Adding reconnection mechanism for players to rejoin in-progress games
   - Enhancing client-side feedback during disconnection periods

3. **Content Enhancement**
   - Continued expansion of question libraries across all game modes
   - Refinement of question quality to improve engagement
   - Better organization of question content

4. **Solo Mode Refinement**
   - Actual gameplay loop for solo mode players
   - Decision on reflection-only vs. simple AI/logic

## Recently Completed Features

1. **Question Set Expansion & Enhancement** (April 2024)
   - Added new "Hot Takes" questions to improve gameplay engagement
   - Updated "Would You Rather" and "Guess Who I Am" question sets
   - Enhanced NSFW content with more engaging options

2. **Rules Overlay & Content Level System**
   - Implemented comprehensive rules display for Player 2
   - Replaced numeric content levels with descriptive group-based names
   - Improved validation across client and server components

3. **GameRoom and UI Enhancements**
   - Improved gameplay experience across components
   - Updated game style terminology for consistency
   - Enhanced prediction phase handling

4. **Technical Improvements**
   - Resolved text wrapping issues in game selection cards
   - Fixed state synchronization bugs in GameRoom.tsx
   - Improved timer functionality and reset mechanics

## Current Technical Challenges

1. **Client-Server State Synchronization**
   - Ensuring consistent state across disconnections/reconnections
   - Managing complex timer and round progression state

2. **React Effects & State Management**
   - Managing complex dependencies in useEffect
   - Preventing stale closures in asynchronous operations

3. **Server-Side Memory**
   - In-memory game state management without persistence
   - Need for database integration for production reliability

## 1. Current Focus

The primary focus is establishing the initial Memory Bank documentation based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD) and analyzing the existing codebase structure. This involves creating the core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** This is the first step in creating the Memory Bank. The `memory-bank` directory and the initial versions of `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` have just been created.
- **Codebase Status (Inferred):** Based on the file structure, foundational UI components (`RoomCreation`, `GameRoom`, specific game modes like `GuessWhoIAm`, `HotTakes`, `ThisOrThat`, `ResultComparison`) and supporting elements (`useGameLogic` hook, `game.ts` types, `gameQuestions.ts`) appear to exist. The exact functionality and completeness of these components are yet to be fully assessed against the PRD.
- **Gameplay Timer Fixes (Nov 2023):** Addressed significant bugs related to the round timer in `GameRoom.tsx`.
    - Server now emits `roundComplete` when both players answer.
    - Client handles `roundComplete` to stop the timer.
    - Fixed timer not restarting or counting down correctly between rounds by correcting `useEffect` dependencies and state management logic in `GameRoom.tsx`.
- **UI Improvements (Apr 2024):** Fixed text wrapping issues in game selection cards.
    - Implemented comprehensive solution for proper text wrapping in the game selection grid
    - Added appropriate CSS classes at multiple container levels to ensure proper overflow handling, width constraints, and word breaking
    - Enhanced user experience by ensuring game descriptions display properly within their containers
- **Deployment (Apr 2024):** Successfully deployed the application.
    - Frontend hosted on Vercel.
    - Node.js/Socket.IO backend hosted on Render.
    - Resolved build issues related to TypeScript paths and shared types.
    - Configured CORS and environment variables for cross-platform communication.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Complete Memory Bank Setup:** Create the remaining core files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
2.  **Code Review & Alignment:** Once the Memory Bank is established, review the existing code components (`src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/types`, `src/utils`) in detail to understand their current state and align them with the requirements documented in the Memory Bank.
3.  **Identify Gaps:** Determine missing features or functionalities based on the PRD and the code review.
4.  **Plan Implementation:** Outline the tasks needed to implement missing features and refine existing ones.
5.  **Continue with Feature Development:** Based on `progress.md`, the next focus areas are likely Prediction Mode logic and Solo Mode refinement.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Documentation First:** Prioritizing the creation of the Memory Bank ensures a shared understanding of the project goals and current state before proceeding with further development.
- **Leverage Existing Code:** Acknowledge the presence of existing components and plan to integrate/refactor them as needed, rather than starting entirely from scratch (unless a review deems it necessary).
- **PRD as Source of Truth:** Use the provided PRD as the primary guide for required features and functionality.
