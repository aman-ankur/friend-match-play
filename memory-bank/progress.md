# Progress: Card Connection

## 1. What Works (As of Recent Updates)

- **Core Frontend/Backend Setup:** Project structured with React/Vite frontend and Node.js/Express backend.
- **Real-time Connection:** Frontend connects to backend via Socket.IO (`SocketContext`).
- **Room Management:**
    - Backend handles `createRoom` and `joinRoom` events.
    - Backend maintains in-memory room state (players, game settings).
    - Server emits `roomCreated`, `joinSuccess`, `roomReady` events.
    - Clients handle these events to navigate and update player lists.
- **Game Start Synchronization:**
    - Creator selects game mode/style.
    - Creator emits `startGame` event.
    - Server validates, generates questions, updates room state.
    - Server emits `gameStarted` to all clients.
    - Clients receive event, update state, and render the correct game component.
- **Basic Gameplay Synchronization (Reveal-Only):**
    - Players emit `submitAnswer`.
    - Server collects answers.
    - When all answers are in, server emits `roundResults`.
    - Clients receive results and display `ResultComparison`.
    - Players emit `playerReady` when clicking continue.
    - Server waits for all players to be ready.
    - Server emits `newRound` or `gameOver`.
    - Clients receive event and update round or display final scores.
- **Disconnection Handling:** Server removes disconnected players and notifies the remaining player (`playerLeft` event).
- **Solo Mode Path:** Basic flow for creating a solo game exists (skips waiting).
- **UI Component Foundation:** Shadcn/ui components for UI elements.
- **Type Definitions:** Shared types mostly consistent between frontend/backend (though potentially need a shared package).

## 2. What's Left to Build / Refine

- **Prediction Mode Logic:**
    - Implement UI for prediction phase in game components.
    - Add `submitPrediction` event/handler.
    - Add server-side score calculation based on predictions and answers.
    - Update `roundResults` and `gameOver` events to include scores.
    - Update `ResultComparison` to display prediction results/scores.
- **Solo Mode Gameplay:**
    - Implement actual gameplay loop for solo mode (currently just lands on game selection).
    - Decide if it's reflection-only or needs simple AI/logic.
- **Data Persistence:** Implement database (e.g., Redis, Postgres) to store room/game state beyond server restarts.
- **Error Handling:** Improve robustness of error handling on both client and server (more specific error events, better user feedback).
- **"Play Again" Functionality:** Implement server/client logic for restarting a game with the same players.
- **UI Refinements:**
    - Indicate who has submitted an answer/is ready for the next round.
    - Improve loading states.
    - Copy-to-clipboard for room code.
    - General polishing, animations.
- **Routing:** Implement proper URL-based routing (`/room/:roomId`).
- **Scalability Considerations:** Refactor if expecting high concurrency.
- **Security:** Input validation, potential rate limiting.
- **Testing:** Add unit/integration/E2E tests.

## 3. Current Status

- **Core Multiplayer Flow Implemented:** Create, join, synchronized game start, reveal-only round progression, and game completion flow are functional using Socket.IO.
- **Server Authoritative:** Backend manages the core game state.
- **Key Missing Features:** Prediction mode logic, robust solo play, data persistence.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- Prediction mode is not implemented.
- Solo mode doesn't have gameplay logic.
- Game state is lost on server restart.
- Limited error feedback to the user.

## Completed Tasks (Recent)

*   **Project Name Change:** Updated project name references.
*   **Solo/2P Mode Selection:** Added UI and state for choosing game mode.
*   **Backend Setup:** Created Node.js/Express/Socket.IO server.
*   **WebSocket Context:** Implemented `SocketContext` on frontend.
*   **Server Room Management:** Added create/join logic, in-memory storage.
*   **Client-Server Integration:** Wired up frontend to emit/listen for create/join events.
*   **Game Start Sync:** Implemented server-side `startGame` and client-side `gameStarted` handling.
*   **Answer Sync:** Implemented `submitAnswer` event and server logic.
*   **Results Sync:** Implemented `roundResults` event and client handling.
*   **Next Round Sync:** Implemented `playerReady` confirmation step and `newRound` event.
*   **Game Over Sync:** Implemented `gameOver` event.
*   **Disconnect Handling:** Basic cleanup and notification.
*   **Numerous Bug Fixes:** Resolved issues related to `process.env`, import paths, prop mismatches, creator detection, race conditions, missing components, and question availability.
*   **Timer Functionality & Fixes:**
    - Implemented `roundComplete` event emission on server after all players answer.
    - Added client-side handling for `roundComplete` to stop timer.
    - Fixed timer not restarting correctly between rounds.
    - Corrected timer countdown logic and dependencies in `GameRoom.tsx`.
    - Ensured `stopTimer` fully resets timer state.
*   **UI Text Wrapping Fixes:**
    - Fixed text overflow issue in game selection cards by implementing proper text wrapping
    - Applied comprehensive solution with `min-w-0`, `max-w-full`, and `overflow-hidden` at multiple container levels
    - Added explicit `whitespace-normal` and `break-words` classes to text elements
    - Implemented inline `wordWrap: 'break-word'` and `hyphens: 'auto'` styles for optimal word breaking

## Current Focus / Next Steps

*   Implement Prediction Mode logic (server-side scoring, client-side prediction UI/events).
*   Refine Solo Mode gameplay.
*   Consider adding data persistence.
*   Improve UI feedback (e.g., showing who is waiting).

## Potential Future Features

*   Different question packs/themes.
*   User accounts and saving game history.
*   Custom game modes or rules.
*   Spectator mode.
*   More sophisticated scoring options.

## Blockers / Issues

*   ~~Game doesn't progress to the next round after results.~~ (Resolved)
*   ~~Friend's prediction is not shown on the results screen in Prediction mode.~~ (Resolved)
*   ~~Timer doesn't restart between rounds / counts down incorrectly.~~ (Resolved)
*   Client-side state management needs to be replaced for true multiplayer.
