# Progress: Card Connection

## 1. What Works (Partially / Inferred)

- **Core Frontend Setup:** Project initialized with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
- **UI Component Foundation:** Shadcn/ui is integrated, providing a base set of reusable UI elements (`src/components/ui/`).
- **Basic Application Structure:**
    - Entry point (`main.tsx`) and root component (`App.tsx`).
    - Page structure (`src/pages/Index.tsx`, `src/pages/NotFound.tsx`).
    - Component scaffolding for key UI areas:
        - `RoomCreation.tsx`
        - `GameRoom.tsx`
        - `GuessWhoIAm.tsx`, `HotTakes.tsx`, `ThisOrThat.tsx`
        - `ResultComparison.tsx`
        - `GameCard.tsx`
- **Type Definitions:** Basic game-related types defined in `src/types/game.ts`.
- **Sample Content:** Initial game questions available in `src/utils/gameQuestions.ts`.
- **Local Logic Hook:** A `useGameLogic.ts` hook exists, suggesting an attempt to encapsulate some game state or actions, likely for local testing or single-player simulation.
- **Development Workflow:** Standard `dev` and `build` scripts are available via npm/bun.

## 2. What's Left to Build (Major Gaps & Next Steps)

- **Real-time Backend Implementation:** **(Highest Priority)**
    - Design and build a backend service (e.g., Node.js + Socket.IO, Firebase, Supabase) to handle:
        - Unique game room creation and management.
        - WebSocket connections for real-time communication between two players.
        - Player state synchronization (joining, leaving, answers, predictions, scores, game phase).
        - Broadcasting game events.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration:**
    - Implement client-side logic to connect to the WebSocket server.
    - Send player actions (answers, predictions) to the backend.
    - Receive and react to real-time updates from the backend to update the UI.
- **Complete Game Logic & Flow:**
    - Implement the full turn-based mechanics for each game mode, including phases (self-answer, prediction).
    - Integrate game logic with the real-time backend for state updates.
    - Implement accurate scoring based on PRD rules for each mode.
    - Handle round progression and end-of-game conditions.
- **Routing:**
    - Implement client-side routing (e.g., using `react-router-dom`) to navigate between:
        - Home/Landing Page (`/`)
        - Game Room (`/room/:roomId`)
        - Potentially separate views for game selection or results.
- **State Management Strategy:**
    - Define and implement a clear state management approach (React Context, Zustand, Redux Toolkit) suitable for managing shared real-time game state alongside local UI state. Refine or replace `useGameLogic` as needed to fit this strategy.
- **Implement PRD Features:**
    - Configurable number of rounds.
    - Option to skip questions.
    - Optional timed responses.
    - Player avatars/nicknames display and input.
    - UI for game mode selection within the room.
    - End-of-game summary screen.
    - "Play Again" / "Change Mode" functionality.
    - Custom question deck creation (lower priority).
- **UI Refinements & Animations:**
    - Implement animations for card flips, reveals, transitions as specified in the PRD.
    - Ensure clean, responsive UI across devices.
    - Implement visual indicators for turns, scores, timing.
- **Testing:**
    - Implement unit tests for hooks and utility functions.
    - Implement integration tests for component interactions.
    - Consider end-to-end tests for the core game flow.

## 3. Current Status

- **Foundation Laid:** The basic frontend project structure and UI component library are in place.
- **Core Functionality Missing:** The application currently lacks the essential real-time backend and associated frontend integration required for its core purpose (two-player remote gameplay).
- **Stage:** Early development. Significant work is required on the backend, real-time communication, and core game logic implementation.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- **No Multi-player Capability:** The primary blocker is the absence of a real-time backend. The application cannot function as intended without it.
- **Incomplete Game Logic:** Existing components likely contain placeholder or incomplete logic.
- **Undefined State Management:** Lack of a clear, robust state management strategy for real-time data.
- **Routing Not Implemented:** Navigation between different parts of the application is not yet functional.

## Completed Tasks

*   **Setup:** Initial project setup with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI.
*   **Core Types:** Defined basic types for `Player`, `GameQuestion`, `GameMode`, `GameStyle`.
*   **Game Logic Hook (`useGameLogic`):** Implemented core logic for handling answers, predictions, calculating results, and managing round state (initial version).
*   **Game Mode Components:** Created basic components for `GuessWhoIAm`, `HotTakes`, `ThisOrThat` using `useGameLogic`.
*   **`GameRoom` Component:** Initial setup for managing game state (players, mode, rounds, status), rendering different game phases/components.
*   **UI Components:** Created `GameCard`, `ResultComparison`, `NSFWSlider` (initial slider version).
*   **Question Loading:** Implemented `getQuestionsByMode` utility.
*   **Round Progression Fix:** Correctly passed and called `handleNextRound` from `GameRoom` via `useGameLogic` to update `currentRound` state.
*   **Home Button:** Added a persistent Home button for navigation back to game selection.
*   **NSFW Slider Redesign:** Replaced the slider with a segmented button control.
*   **Timer Functionality:** Added timer duration selection (0s, 15s, 30s, 45s) and a visual timer widget during question phases.
*   **Results Display Fix (Reveal-Only):** Ensured `ResultComparison` correctly displays both players' answers when `showPredictions` is false.
*   **Results Display Fix (Prediction):** Resolved issue where the second player's prediction wasn't shown for the first player by using `useEffect` in `useGameLogic` to calculate results only after prediction state updates.

## Current Focus / Next Steps

*   **Real-time Multiplayer:** Integrate WebSocket (e.g., Socket.IO) or a similar solution for real-time updates (player joining, answer/prediction synchronization, state changes).
    *   Refactor state management (`GameRoom` state currently client-side only).
    *   Implement server-side game logic.
*   **Timer Timeout Logic:** Implement consequences for the timer running out (e.g., default answer, skip turn).
*   **Error Handling & Edge Cases:** Add more robust error handling throughout the application.
*   **UI Polishing:** Refine animations, transitions, and overall visual appeal based on `@ui-guidelines.md`.
*   **Accessibility (a11y):** Review and improve accessibility.
*   **Testing:** Implement unit and potentially integration tests (e.g., using Jest/React Testing Library).

## Potential Future Features

*   Different question packs/themes.
*   User accounts and saving game history.
*   Custom game modes or rules.
*   Spectator mode.
*   More sophisticated scoring options.

## Blockers / Issues

*   ~~Game doesn't progress to the next round after results.~~ (Resolved)
*   ~~Friend's prediction is not shown on the results screen in Prediction mode.~~ (Resolved)
*   Client-side state management needs to be replaced for true multiplayer.
