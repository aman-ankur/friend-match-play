# Progress: Card Connection

## 1. What Works (As of Recent Updates)

- **Core Frontend/Backend Setup:** Project structured with React/Vite frontend and Node.js/Express backend.
- **Real-time Connection:** Frontend connects to backend via Socket.IO (`SocketContext`).
- **Room Management:**
    - Backend handles `createRoom` and `joinRoom` events.
    - Backend maintains in-memory room state (players, game settings).
    - Server emits `roomCreated`, `joinSuccess`, `roomReady` events.
    - Clients handle these events to navigate and update player lists.
- **Game Start Synchronization:**
    - Creator selects game mode/style.
    - Creator emits `startGame` event.
    - Server validates, generates questions, updates room state.
    - Server emits `gameStarted` to all clients.
    - Clients receive event, update state, and render the correct game component.
- **Basic Gameplay Synchronization (Reveal-Only):**
    - Players emit `submitAnswer`.
    - Server collects answers.
    - When all answers are in, server emits `roundResults`.
    - Clients receive results and display `ResultComparison`.
    - Players emit `playerReady` when clicking continue.
    - Server waits for all players to be ready.
    - Server emits `newRound` or `gameOver`.
    - Clients receive event and update round or display final scores.
- **Prediction Mode Gameplay:**
    - Players first submit answers as in Reveal-Only mode.
    - When all answers are in, server emits `predictionPhase` event.
    - Clients transition to prediction UI with distinct styling.
    - Players emit `submitPrediction` for what they think the other player answered.
    - Server collects predictions and calculates scores (1 point per correct prediction).
    - Server emits `roundResults` with prediction and score data.
    - ResultComparison displays both answers and predictions with correctness indicators.
- **Exclusive Mode:**
    - PIN-protected mode for "This or That" games with adult content
    - Can be activated during setup or gameplay (only by creator)
    - Special set of questions with `nsfwRating: 11`
    - Unlimited rounds that continue until questions exhausted or manually ended
    - UI indicators showing mode is active
- **Reset Functionality:**
    - After game completion, room can be reset to play again
    - Server reset ensures proper room state transitions
    - All players get synchronized back to game selection
- **Rules Overlay:**
    - Informative overlay for Player 2 to understand game rules before starting
    - Shows comprehensive game settings including mode, style, content level, etc.
    - Integrated with game flow and playerReady events
- **Enhanced Content Level System:**
    - Replaced numeric "spiciness" levels with fun, descriptive group-based names
    - Improved validation across client and server components
    - Better UI representation of content levels
- **Improved Question Sets:**
    - Expanded question libraries for all game modes
    - Added new "Hot Takes" questions for enhanced engagement
    - Updated existing questions for better gameplay experience
    - Enhanced NSFW content with more engaging options
- **Disconnection Handling:** Server removes disconnected players and notifies the remaining player (`playerLeft` event).
- **Solo Mode Path:** Basic flow for creating a solo game exists (skips waiting).
- **UI Component Foundation:** Shadcn/ui components for UI elements.
- **Type Definitions:** Shared types mostly consistent between frontend/backend (though potentially need a shared package).

## 2. What's Left to Build / Refine

- **Solo Mode Gameplay:**
    - Implement actual gameplay loop for solo mode (currently just lands on game selection).
    - Decide if it's reflection-only or needs simple AI/logic.
- **Data Persistence:** Implement database (e.g., Redis, Postgres) to store room/game state beyond server restarts.
- **Error Handling:** Improve robustness of error handling on both client and server (more specific error events, better user feedback).
- **Temporary Disconnection Handling:** Implement grace period for disconnections to allow players to rejoin ongoing games.
- **UI Refinements:**
    - Indicate who has submitted an answer/is ready for the next round.
    - Improve loading states.
    - Copy-to-clipboard for room code.
    - General polishing, animations.
- **Routing:** Implement proper URL-based routing (`/room/:roomId`).
- **Scalability Considerations:** Refactor if expecting high concurrency.
- **Security:** Input validation, potential rate limiting.
- **Testing:** Add unit/integration/E2E tests.

## 3. Current Status

- **Core Multiplayer Flow Implemented:** Create, join, synchronized game start, both reveal-only and prediction mode round progression, and game completion flow are functional using Socket.IO.
- **Server Authoritative:** Backend manages the core game state.
- **Exclusive Mode:** Working implementation of PIN-protected adult content.
- **Room Reset:** Implemented functionality to reset room after game completion.
- **Prediction Mode:** Complete implementation of prediction phase, scoring, and results display.
- **Enhanced Content:** Expanded question libraries across all game modes with improved engagement.
- **Rules Overlay:** Player 2 can now view comprehensive game information before starting.
- **Key Missing Features:** Robust solo play, data persistence, temporary disconnection handling.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- Solo mode doesn't have gameplay logic.
- Game state is lost on server restart.
- Limited error feedback to the user.
- No grace period for temporary disconnections - players cannot rejoin ongoing games.
